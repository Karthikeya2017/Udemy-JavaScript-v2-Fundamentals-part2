Objects are Non - primitive data types. 
Objects are another data structure in JS , to hold different values of Obj in one place.

- > Objects contains key, which called as properties .
Values are assigned to keys.

const sampleObject = {
    firstName: 'Gopikrishna',
    lastName: 'Pentyala',
    country: 'India'
}

Above one is called Object literal. 

const sampleObject2 = new Object();

Operation is nothing but an expression , which produces a value.

to get values from Object ==> . OR []

. ==> used to get final value. 
[ ] ==> computed 

*** Important ***
1. Object returns undefined when Key doesn't exists in Object.
2. Functions are nothing but values. Hence we cab use them in Objects.
