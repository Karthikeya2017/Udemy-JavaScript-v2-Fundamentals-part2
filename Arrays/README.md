-> Arrays are fundamental data structure of JavaScript. 

- Array is big data contianer structure and store the values. 

Two most important data structures in JavaScript are
    1. Array
    2. Object

two ways we can create Array:-

1. const countries = [ 'India', 'Netherlands', 'Australia' ];
2. const years = new Array (1986, 1987, 2008, 2010, 2017, 2020);

Defination of Expression:- It produces some value, 
function expressions , array.length -1 

**** Important ****

Arrays are Non premitive data types, we can mutate/change Non primitive data types.

- only primitive data types

1. Numbers
2. Strings
3. Booleans
4. undefined
5. null
6. Big int
7. Symbol
- Non-Primitive (referred to collectively as Objects)
1. Objects
2. Arrays
3. Functions
- > The two categories represent the two different ways these data types are stored into memory. 

- Primitives are stored by value while Non-Primitives (Objects) are stored by reference.

- JavaScript expects each positon as  'expression'

> const arr = ['gopi', 34, ['Karthikeya', 'NagaLakshmi']]
undefined
> arr[arr.length -1].length -1
1
> (arr[arr.length -1]).length
